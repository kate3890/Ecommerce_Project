## Project Description:

This e-commerce website is a mockup for a home page of a e-petstore, as the requirement was to create a static single page website, I made sure that all the links in the header link to different section in the same page. The main page consists of the header section, featured products, that can be multiplied and added to a cart, and a cart section that displays the subtotal and total price.

## Improvements for 2,0 version:

The website can be improved through implementation of the checkout function and additional pages:

- product page
- about us/contact page
- user page (sign in & wish list)
  Further more it would be benefitial to have individual pages for each prouct with detailed descriptions.
